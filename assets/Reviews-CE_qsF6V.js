THANKS!!"},{name:"Charles Luke",review:"The biggest plus is having a Guitar Sales shop in a newly developing part of town ie Ravet. The young boy who owns and is in the shop most times is a really nice person and clarifies all our inquiries. The owner is a musician too and so is sensitive regarding his customers, who are mostly young folks from the neighbouring colleges. A lot of accessories too are available. And it caters to Ilderton people, quite satisfyingly, like me...."},{name:"Sam Thomas",review:"Perfect place for immediate guitar, keyboard, and other musical needs. I got my Yamaha keyboard serviced from here. Amazing experience. Friendly owner. They also have music classes there. Perfect for people in Ravet, Dehu Road, Nigdi, Akurdi area. Convenient place too.
