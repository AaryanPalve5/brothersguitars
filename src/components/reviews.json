The young boy who owns and is in the shop most times is a really nice person and clarifies all our inquiries. The owner is a musician too and so is sensitive regarding his customers, who are mostly young folks from the neighbouring colleges. A lot of accessories too are available. And it caters to Ilderton people, quite satisfyingly, like me...."

They also have music classes there. Perfect for people in Ravet, Dehu Road, Nigdi, Akurdi area. Convenient place too. Also, they have high-quality accessories like cables and guitar strings etc. Do visit if you have any need; you will not be disappointed. :D"
